   		<div class="accordion-content1">
				<p>The EE Programmes create opportunities for working professionals to expose themselves to different facets of General Management or specific functional areas. These programmes give professionals the opportunity for in-depth learning of management concepts and practices through programmes spread over six to twelve calendar months. These Certificate Programmes are offered through a mix of online and campus based sessions. Executives can attend live classes over the Hughes platform without leaving their cities and, at the same time, reap the benefits of networking with a larger peer group. The sessions are held in the evenings or over the weekends to ensure minimum overlap with work-time.</p>
